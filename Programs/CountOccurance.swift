// Count number of occurrences (or frequency) in a sorted array
// Find first and last positions of an element in a sorted array
// using binary search
// Time Complexity: O(Logn)
// Auxiliary Space: O(1), as no extra space is used
// Programming Paradigm: Divide & Conquer

//Steps
//1) Use Binary search to get index of the first occurrence of x in arr[].
//2) Use Binary search to get index of the last occurrence of x in arr[].
//3) Return (Last â€“ First + 1);
